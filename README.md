# Simulated Wave Form Generator for IoT Edge


Below are the desired properties in Json used by the module:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "desired": {
            "SendData": true,
            "Frequency": 1,
            "Amplitude": 1,
            "VerticalShift": 0,
            "SendInterval": 0.05,
            "WaveType": "Sine"
        }
    }
}
```

| Twin Property  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| SendData  | starts or stops pushing messages to the output endpoint  |
| SendInterval  | the amount of time in seconds between value publishes  |
| Frequency  | the frequency of the wave in Hz  |
| Amplitude  | the aplitude of the wave |
| VerticalShift  | shift the wave vertically by some constant amount  |
| WaveType  | tells the simulator which type of wave to produce  |
